abstract: We demonstrate that a Δ-density functional theory (Δ-DFT) approach
  based on atom-centered potentials (ACPs) represents a computationally
  inexpensive and accurate method for representing potential energy surfaces
  (PESs) for the HONO and HFCO molecules and vibrational frequencies derived
  therefrom. Using as few as 100 CCSD(T)-F12a reference energies, ACPs developed
  for use with B3LYP/def2-TZVPP are shown to produce PESs for HONO and HFCO with
  mean absolute errors of 27.7 and 5.8 cm–1, respectively. Application of the
  multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method with ACP-corrected
  B3LYP/def2-TZVPP PESs produces vibrational frequencies for cis- and trans-HONO
  with mean absolute percent errors (MAPEs) of 0.8 and 1.1, compared to 0.8
  obtained for the two isomers with CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12/MCTDH. For HFCO,
  the vibrational frequencies obtained using the present (Δ-DFT)/MCTDH approach
  give a MAPE of 0.1, which is the error obtained with
  CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12/MCTDH. The ACP approach is therefore successful in
  representing a PES calculated at a high level of theory (CCSD(T)-F12a) and a
  promising method for the development of a general protocol for the
  representation of accurate molecular PESs and the calculation of molecular
  properties from them.
