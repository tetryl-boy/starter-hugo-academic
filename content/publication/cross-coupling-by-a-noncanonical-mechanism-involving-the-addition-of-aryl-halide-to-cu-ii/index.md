abstract: Copper complexes are widely used in the synthesis of fine chemicals
  and materials to catalyze couplings of heteroatom nucleophiles with aryl
  halides. We show that cross-couplings catalyzed by some of the most active
  catalysts occur by a mechanism not previously considered. Copper(II) [Cu(II)]
  complexes of oxalamide ligands catalyze Ullmann coupling to form the C–O bond
  in aryl ethers by concerted oxidative addition of an aryl halide to Cu(II) to
  form a high-valent species that is stabilized by radical character on the
  oxalamide ligand. This mechanism diverges from those involving Cu(I) and
  Cu(III) intermediates that have been posited for other Ullmann-type couplings.
  The stability of the Cu(II) state leads to high turnover numbers, >1000 for
  the coupling of phenoxide with aryl chloride electrophiles, as well as an
  ability to run the reactions in air.
