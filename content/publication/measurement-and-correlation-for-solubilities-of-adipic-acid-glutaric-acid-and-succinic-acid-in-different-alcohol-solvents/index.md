abstract: In this research, the solubilities of adipic acid in sec-butyl alcohol
  (SBA), isobutyl alcohol (IBA), and n-octyl alcohol (NOA); glutaric acid in
  n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, SBA, IBA, tert-butyl
  alcohol (TBA), and NOA; and succinic acid in SBA, IBA, TBA, and NOA were
  determined by the dynamic laser method from 302.65 to 352.95 K at atmospheric
  pressure (101.3 kPa). Furthermore, the solubilities of three dibasic acids in
  straight-chain alcohols of different lengths and alcohol isomers were
  compared. Meanwhile, X-ray diffraction was used to detect the change of the
  crystal form before and after dissolution. Additionally, the experimental data
  were correlated by two models (Apelblat model and the modified nonrandom two
  liquid activity coefficient model), showing that the model matched well with
  the experimental data. The most accurate model is selected for every system
  after calculating the Akaike information criterion of each model.
