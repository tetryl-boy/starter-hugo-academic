abstract: Ring-opening of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) is emerging as a powerful
  strategy for 1,3-difunctionalized cyclobutane synthesis. However, reported
  radical strain-release reactions are typically plagued with
  diastereoselectivity issues. Herein, an atom-economic protocol for the highly
  chemo- and diastereoselective polar strain-release ring-opening of BCBs with
  hydroxyarenes catalyzed by a π-acid catalyst AgBF4 has been developed. The use
  of readily available starting materials, low catalyst loading, high
  selectivity (up to >98 : 2 d.r.), a broad substrate scope, ease of scale-up,
  and versatile functionalizations of the cyclobutane products make this
  approach very attractive for the synthesis of 1,1,3-trisubstituted
  cyclobutanes. Moreover, control experiments and theoretical calculations were
  performed to illustrate the reaction mechanism and selectivity.
